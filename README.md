## What is Python?

  - Python is one of the most popular and widely used scripting languages around the world. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Its popularity boosted over the last few decades, thereby pushing some languages into extinction. Stack Overflow conducted a survey in 2017 that showed that around thirty-two percent of developers used Python while twenty percent were keen to learn. It is popular among new developers mainly due to its clean and easy to understand syntax and its availability on different platforms like Linux, Windows, RaspberryPi, etc. It is an advanced language that works and provides services across several software platforms. Its presence in the web domain is quite strong as it possesses libraries that can be interfaced with web protocols and the internet. 

  - The most recent version of Python is Python 3. Python 2 is still widely popular and the only difference in them is a few changes in security. The wide range of tutorials available on the internet make the process of learning Python easier and more inviting as compared to other languages. Once armed with the basic understanding of the modules, concepts and syntaxes, developers can tinker with numerous mini projects. It can be used in several domains like Web Development (server-side), software development, system scripting, mathematics, etc. It can be used to perform functions like rapid prototyping as well. 

  - On several occasions Python has been identified as an Integration Language. The existing software components are joined or “glued” together using Python. It offers modules that make large components, written in languages like C or C++, be available to a Python Programmer. Python exception provides information related to the glue extensions that have been used to convert data types between Python and C or C++. It also checks for error and translation errors. It is preferred world-wide because several different programmers can work together to develop applications. One does not need to learn the low-level programming language AND the science behind it in order to deploy a project. 

### Benefits of learning Python:

  1. As python programming can be used in a multitude of ways and in several domains, they are extremely popular and thus have a lot of job openings. The language is a favourite for most start-ups, especially when they are building up their digital profile. 
  
  2. Its efficiency and reduced development time make it one of the most favoured language in companies across the world. 
  
  3. The language is very easy to learn as compared to the other ones in the field. It is similar to the English language, due to which understanding and decoding becomes a lot easier. There are several tutorials available on the internet which make the learning journey considerably easier and smoother. Many professionals believe that learning the basics of Python takes around 5 to 6 weeks only, this is enough to get a good grasp of the working and syntaxes. 
  
  4. The versatile nature of python makes it the developers best friend. This why tech giants like Google and Facebook heavily concentrate on this language. Its versatility allows the developer to work on a wide variety of options. 
  
  5. As Python is an open-source software, it has a large user community and an equally large support community as well. Open-source means that anyone on the internet can make changes to the language. They can create extensions, modify them and make relevant changes to the libraries and frameworks as well. In case you feel that you are alone on you journey towards learning python, don’t worry, the Python Software Foundation provides you with the support you need. They link you with fellow enthusiasts and provide you with a platform to share your journey and experiences with others. 
  
  7. Python offers a lot of flexibility, quite similar to JavaScript. One can make use of its libraries and frameworks to fulfil their coding requirements. 
  
  8. Boring parts of your job like copying and dragging files, renaming them, etc can now be automated. Menial tasks that reduce your productivity can now be automated by writing a few scripts.  Automating processes with python saves a large amount of time.
